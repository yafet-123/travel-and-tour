        title: 'Lake Tana Monasteries',
        detail: `The Lake Tana area was important in the fourteenth, fifteenth and sixteenth centuries in
            view of its role in maintaining the Christian faith against contemporary pressures, and
            the rise of the Solomonic Dynasty which patronized the building of churches and
            monasteries. Many of the earliest manuscripts and precious examples of ecclesiastical art as well as
            royal objects were safely stored in their treasuries. At the same time, new religious arts
            were developed and displayed in the churches. The oldest of these forty or so churches
            have their origins in the fourteenth century. They reflect the native building tradition in
            their round shape, materials and building techniques. Each one consists of three parts:
            the inner sanctuary, the inner ambulatory and the outer ambulatory. The outside walls
            of the sanctuary are usually covered with magnificent paintings. Seven of the most
            accessible and representative of these churches, still serving their original function, have
            been selected for the international campaign: Kebran Gabriel, Ura Kidane Mehret,
            Narga Selassie, Daga Estifanos, Medhane Alem of Rema, Kota Maryam and Mertola
            Maryam.

        detail: `It stands 32m tall and has a crenulated parapet and four domed towers. Made of roughly
            hewn stones, it’s reputedly the work of an Indian architect and shows an unusual
            synthesis of Indian, Portuguese, Moorish and Aksumite influences. The main floor was
            used as dining halls and a formal reception area. Note the wall reliefs, including several
            Stars of David, which trumpet Fasiladas’ link to the Solomonic dynasty. The small room
            in the northern corner boasts its original beam ceiling and some faint frescoes. On the
            1st floor, Fasiladas’ prayer room has windows in four directions, each overlooking
            Gonder’s important churches. Religious ceremonies were held on the roof, and it was
            from here that he addressed his people. Above Fasiladas’ 2nd-floor bedroomwas the watchtower, 
            from where it’s (apparently) possible to see all the way to Lake Tana.
            Behind the castle are various ruined buildings, including the kitchen (domed ceiling),
            steam bath and water cistern.`,

        detail: `The rock-hewn churches at Lalibela exemplify a building tradition that has been used in
          Ethiopia since the 6th and 7th centuries, but these churches are attributed to the
          13th-century King Lalibela. They demonstrate an extraordinary level of architectural
          detail in their construction. Today, the churches are still very much alive, and a place of
          pilgrimage for many Ethiopians.There are two main groups of churches – to the north of the river Jordan: Biete
          Medhani Alem (House of the Saviour of the World), Biete Mariam (House of Mary),
          Biete Maskal (House of the Cross), Biete Denagel (House of Virgins), Biete Golgotha
          Mikael (House of Golgotha Mikael); and to the south of the river, Biete Amanuel (House
          of Emmanuel), Biete Qeddus Mercoreus (House of St. Mercoreos), Biete Abba Libanos
          (House of Abbot Libanos), Biete Gabriel Raphael (House of Gabriel Raphael), and Biete
          Lehem (House of Holy Bread). The eleventh church, Biete Ghiorgis (House of St.
          George), is isolated from the others, but connected by a system of trenches.
          The comprehensive slideshow includes pictures of many of the churches and their
          connecting paths and tunnels, with detailed studies of some of the design features cut
          into the rock. Some examples of ancient religious art and manuscripts, maintained by
          the priests in each church are shown.`,

        detail: `Formerly the heart of the Axumite empire that spanned for nearly one thousand years,
          Axum is home to a 24-metre megalith surrounded by a ring of smaller Obelisks.
          Built in the 4th century by King Ezana, the 160 tonne monument had stood in place for
          over a thousand years, until the colonial aspirations of a nation far from Ethiopia
          arrived at her borders.The Italian occupation of Ethiopia is considered by many a period of hardship within
          the country, with many long hidden artefacts and national treasures being stolen by the
          occupiers, and despite its mammoth measurements, the Monolith of Axum was taken
          from Ethiopians in the 1930s. Found, semi-submerged in a pit by a group of Italian
          soldiers in 1935, the Obelisk was removed from its home, partially dismantled, and after
          over two years in limbo, was transported to Rome as a spoil of war`,

          erosion over millions of years has created jagged mountain peaks, deep valleys and
          sharp precipices dropping some 1,500 m. The park is of global significance for
          biodiversity conservation because it is home to globally threatened species, including
          the iconic Walia ibex, a wild mountain goat found nowhere else in the world, the Gelada
          baboon and the Ethiopian wolf. The property’s spectacular landscape is part of the Simien mountain massif, which is
          located on the northern limit of the main Ethiopian plateau and includes the highest
          point in Ethiopia, Ras Dejen. The undulating plateau of the Simien mountains has over
          millions of years been eroded to form precipitous cliffs and deep gorges of exceptional
          natural beauty. Some cliffs reach 1,500 m in height and the northern cliff wall extends
          for some 35 km. The mountains are bounded by deep valleys to the north, east and
          south, and offer vast vistas over the rugged-canyon like lowlands below.`,

          might feel as if they had landed on a different planet. The Danakil Depression is
          extremely hot, and features bubbling volcanoes and a unique landscape.
          Situated 100 meters and more below sea level, it is a natural wonder with a complex
          geological history. Three tectonic plates meet at the Danakil Depression, which is the
          result of Africa and Asia moving apart. This has provoked rifting and volcanic activity.
          Even though Danakil is the hottest place on earth, many travelers visit the depression.
          The Danakil’s top attraction is Erta Ale, a 613m-high shield volcano whose caldera of
          crumbling black rock contains the world’s oldest permanent lava lake. Bubbling at
          temperatures of more than 1,000˚C, this ellipsoid cauldron of black-and-red magma is a
          truly mesmerizing phenomenon, as violent red fountains of molten rock spurt tens of
          meters in the sky, accompanied by nose-searing waves of ammonia gas.`,

          and lasts for two days. Legend says that the cross upon which Christ was crucified was
          discovered in the year 326 by Queen Helena, mother of Constantine the Great. Unable
          to find the holy artifact, she set up long poles and set them on fire. Skyward raised the
          smoke and down it bent, touching the spot on the earth where the original cross was
          found buried. Queen Helen lit up torches heralding her success to the neighboring areas.
          This festival is also registered with UNESCO as an element of the Intangible Cultural
          Heritage of Humanity. The centrepiece of this unique festival is the lighting of a massive
          conical bonfire called a Damera and all the dancing and feasting surrounding it. The
          largest Meskel gathering takes place in Addis Ababa’s Meskel Square, where hundreds
          of thousands of people, both locals and tourists, gather to watch the colourfully dressed

          celebrate Timket is Gondar, Once King Fassiledes’s Castle transformed into a church.
          This sacred place is now the most symbolic of all churches in Ethiopia when it comes to
          the annual Timket ceremony. This is due to the fact that Gondar it is the only city to
          hold all the forty four Tabots or arks togather at this significant time.
          What makes the festival so unique is that it's the only time when the Tabot - a replica of
          the Ark of the Covenant containing the Ten Commandments - is taken out from the
          churches across the country. Covered by an ornamental cloth, accompanied by songs,
