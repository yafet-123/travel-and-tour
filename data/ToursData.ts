      continuously active volcanos in the world, and a member of an even more exclusive
      group: volcanos with lava lakes. While there are only five known volcanos with lava
      lakes globally, Erta Ale often has two active lava lakes – making it a unique site. Erta Ale
      was discovered in 1906, making it the longest-known lava lake. Dallol has some of the
      most colorful landscapes on Earth. The hot magma below heats groundwater flowing in
      from the surrounding highlands. This hot water moves up toward the surface and
      through the evaporite deposits, dissolving salt, potash, and other soluble minerals.`,

      an area for a great trekking experience Trekking in the Bale Mountains is easy and can
      be done by everybody who can deal with the high altitude of more than 4000m. The
      Mountains support the most extensive area of Afro alpine and sub alpine Ericaceous
      vegetation in Africa. They have the highest rate of animal endemicity of any terrestrial
      habitat in the world, which was the principal reason for the creation of the Bale
      Mountains National Park in 1970. Book this trip to enjoy the stunning scenery, the
      endemic mammals and birds of Ethiopia.
      The high altitude, afro-montane Sanetti Plateau rises to over 4,000m and includes the
      highest peak in the southern Ethiopia highlands. This undulating plateau is marked by
      numerous glacial lakes and swamps and surrounded by higher volcanic ridges and
      peaks. The southern slopes are covered by the lush and largely unexplored Harenna
      Forest. The place is known for its unimaginable and wholly unique natural beauty and
      wildlife. Thanks to the isolation of these mountains, the park has an incredibly high
      number of endemic species, and the wide altitudinal range has resulted in a variety of
      belts of vegetation that support many niche species of both flora and fauna. The open
      spaces of the high Sanetti Plateau are possibly the easiest place to see the rare Ethiopian
      wolf, while nearby Harenna Forest is the place to find bush pig, giant forest hog, grey
      duiker and occasionally lion and leopard. Menelik’s bushbuck, the endemic mountain
      Nyala and giant mole rat, all endemic to the Bale Mountains, can also be seen here. The
      park is a bird paradise with several endemic birds including the thick-billed raven,
      Wattled Ibis, blue-winged goose, and Rouget’s rail.`,
